Changes to code from assignment 5-6 (Doesn't include new implementations)

1. Changed names of classes/interfaces to replicate the common terminology used by the assignment:
    - AnimationManager is now Animation
    - AnimationManagerModel is now AnimationModel
    - Animation is now Motion
    - AnimationModel is now MotionModel

2. Added the following classes:
    - Canvas: Represents the bounds of an animation
    - ImmutableModel: Represents an immutable implementation of the animation model

3. Removed the following classes:
    - EmptyAnimation, ColorAnimation, MoveAnimation, SizeAnimation, FadeAnimation
    - Reason: I thought that motions could only mutate certain properties per motion. After
    realizing that this wasn't the case, there was no use for different kinds of motions

4. Changes to existing classes/interfaces:
    - Motion/MotionModel: Now Motion is a concrete class instead of an abstract class since
    different types of motions aren't relevant
    - Shape: Added a makeCopy method that instantiates a new instance of a given shape
    - Animation/AnimationModel:
       - Removed useless methods including replaceShape and getAnimationState and getTime,
       which didn't have any application to the views
       - Added a builder which is a nested class to construct an Animation
       - Added a method to check for consistent animations (no time gaps or overlap)
       - Scrapped the idea of an animation increment as frame rate isn't relevant to the assignment
       details
       - Adjusted toString like methods to fit the desired specification for the text view

5. Changes to existing test classes:
    - Removed all tests regarding different kinds of motions as those classes were deleted
    - Added tests to check for animation consistency
    - Fixed tests in AnimationTest to adjust for changes to the class
